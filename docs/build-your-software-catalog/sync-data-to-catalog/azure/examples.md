:::

<StorageAccountBlueprint/>

<StorageContainerBlueprint/>

<StorageAppConfig/>

## Mapping Compute Resources

In the following example you will ingest your Azure Resources to Port, you may use the following Port blueprint definitions and integration configuration:

:::note
The Resources below have a relation to the Resource Group, so creation of the [Resource Group blueprint](#mapping-resource-groups) is required.
