## Visualization types

### Pie chart

You can create a pie chart illustrating data from entities in your software catalog divided by categories and entity properties inside a specific entity page [**specific entity page**](../page/entity-page.md).

### Metric chart

You can create a metric visualization from related entities in the [**specific entity page**](../page/entity-page.md). You can either count the entities or perform an aggregation function on a number property. You can also filter entities so the aggregation metric will only apply to a limited set of entities with Port's [Search Rules](../../search-and-query/search-and-query.md#rules)

## Chart filters

The chart filters allow to include or exclude specific data from the visualization. The filters are based on Port's [Search Rules](../../search-and-query/search-and-query.md#rules)

### Filter example: only deployment entities from the last week

Let's assume we have a [blueprint](../../build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/setup-blueprint.md) that is called `Service` which is related to another blueprint called `Deployment`, and we want to create visualizations on top of the last week's deployments of this service.

To achieve this desired state, we can go into one of the `Service`'s profile pages and create a new visualization. After selecting the `Deployment` blueprint in the dropdown, we can add the following filter to the `Filters` array:

```json showLineNumbers
[
  {
    "property": "$createdAt",
    "operator": "between",
    "value": {
      "preset": "lastWeek"
    }
  }
]
```
