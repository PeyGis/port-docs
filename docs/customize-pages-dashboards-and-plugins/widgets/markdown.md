# Markdown

With Port, you can import and display [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files as tabs.

By using the combination of `"type": "string` and `"format": "markdown"` in a [Blueprint property](../../build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/properties.md#structure), Port will format and display the markdown text in the [Specific entity page](../page/entity-page.md).

## Definition in Blueprint

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "title": "Markdown Property",
  "type": "string",
  "format": "markdown",
  "description": "A Markdown property"
}
```

## Example

Here is how the Markdown tab in the specific entity page appears when markdown text is provided:

### Mermaid

The markdown widget also supports [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/), a diagramming and charting tool that uses text and code to generate diagrams and charts.

To use Mermaid with the markdown widget, all you need to do is add mermaid syntax to the markdown property. You can refer to the [Mermaid Examples](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/examples.html) for more examples and information on how to use it.
